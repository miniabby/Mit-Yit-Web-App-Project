 | Match History | match_history.pug, match_his_req.css | /match/history | matchControllers | Users.js
 | Match Request | match_request.pug, match_his_req.css | /match/request | matchControllers | Users.js

  ### 3. Review system
 In this system, users can manage theirs reviews. Users can write reviews to matched users, as well as checking reviews about themselves from other users.

  URLs：
  
  https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review
  
  https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review/write
 
  https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review/view

  | Functionality            | Views             | Routes  | Controllers | Models
 | :----------------------- | :---------------  | :------ | :------ | :------ 
 | Review | review.pug, review.css | /review | reviewControllers | Users.js
 | Write Review | write_review.pug, review.css | /review/write | reviewControllers | Users.js
 | View Review | view_review.pug, review.css | /review/view | reviewControllers | Users.js

  ### Test
  We tested the signup and login functions in our userController by using Chai, sinon and supertest packages. By create fake request and response variable, we have successfully pass the test which submits valid user information and invalid user infomation.
  To run the test of this project, simply type "npm test" in the termial, then you can see the message of test passing.

  ### Sample login details
    Below is sample login details of one of our account.
    Username: Abigail; password: qwqwqw
    By entering the above informmation, you can login our app, view the personal information and all the matching histories, matching requests and reviews.

## Deliverable 2:

The link to Git repository for the web application is https://github.com/GilfoylePP/Mit_and_Yit--INFO30005.  
The URL to the live website is https://mityit.herokuapp.com.  
The commit id is **c69c43a**.


Three core functionalities, **user profile**, **matching system** and **review system**, have been implemented separately by using three routers. Detailed descriptions are listed below. 

Below is the data structure for users. Currently our database has users with id 1~9.  
```markdown
{  
    "id":               int,      // a unique int that identifies a user  
    "username":         String,  
    "email":            String,  
    "cuisine":          String,   // their food preference  
    "lunch":            Boolean,  // availability for lunch   
    "dinner":           Boolean,  // availability for dinner  
    "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,  // availability for coffee  
    "reviewIndex":      int       // a unique index position that help to retrieve user's review from the Review database  
}  
```
Below is an exapmle of the data structure for reviews, which shows the review for user id 1, which is at index 0 position.   
```
{  
   score:          3.5,  // int, average score calculated based on all reviews  
   scoreNum:       2,    // int, number of review messages received  
   review:               // an array that store all review messages  
        [{  
          givenBy: 2,  
          date:    "03-04-2019",  
          tag:     ["nice","interesting"],  
          comment: "really nice and kind",  
         },  
         {  
          givenBy: 7,  
          date:    "09-04-2019",  
          score:   3,  
          tag:     ["boring","kind"],  
          comment: "xx is nice but we have no common interest",  
         }]  
}  
```

### 1. Users' information system (userRouter)

Our first core functionality is user system. It allows to view all users’ information, extract an existing user's information, modify existing user's information, and add new user to json file.  

* https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info
  * **GET** request - retrieve all users' information  

* https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id
  * **GET** request - retrieve a particular user's information by id  

* https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id
  * **PATCH** request - update an existing user's information by id  
  * Input JSON file: 
    ```
    {  
      "id":               int,  
      "username":         String,  
      "email":            String,  
      "cuisine":          String,  
      "lunch":            Boolean,  
      "dinner":           Boolean,  
      "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,  
      "reviewIndex":      int  
    }  
    ```
    Example for updating an existing user's information:                                         
    Url to test: https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/7  
    Original information:  
    ```
    {  
      "id":               7,  
      "username":         "user7",  
      "email":            "email_7@gmail.com",  
      "cuisine":          "Italian",
